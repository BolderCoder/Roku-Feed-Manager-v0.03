# Learn To Program with a study guide

C# - Python - PHP - JavaScript - BrightScript/SceneGraph (Roku)

Hi! My name is Bill, and I am an old nerd with a young attitude. I have literal decades of experience writing code to learn, to automate tasks in my job as a Network Administrator and taxicab dispatcher. I've created self-updating websites featuring current news headlines from around the world. I've created software to remotely control ham radios and police scanners.  I want to help people learn how to design, develop, debug, and deploy software using modern, common, and in-demand languages such as C#, Python, JavaScript, and more. And in the process, I can help you develop common skills that will allow you to swiftly and competently develop in other languages.

Unlike classroom training, a program can be developed which is tailored specifically to your particular needs and goals. With one-on-one training, we can work at your speed and slow down to focus on challenging topics where needed.

I use free, high quality websites to help you learn both effectively and affordably. I put you to work creating relatable projects which give you experience in a variety of application and data types. I put you in a position where you can effectively take over your training in a reasonable amout of time. I try to help my students gain the confidence they need to succeed, and seek to create a harmonious, positive attitude.

If you are ready to level up your coding skills and confidence, give me a call at 248-987-8294 and we can discuss whether personal programming education is right for you!
